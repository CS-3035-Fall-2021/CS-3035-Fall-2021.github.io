Attendance in-person is strongly encouraged, but will always follow the [latest policies set by the University](https://www.unb.ca/coronavirus/students/returning/index.html). 

### Recording of Class Time

All lectures will be broadcast and recorded, while this is done primarily for students who are unable to make it to class, all students will have access to these recordings. Tests and quizzes will not be recorded. 

## Course Work Details

Below is an overview of course work.  

### Course Work and Marking Scheme (Tentative)

The grading scheme and number of items in the grade (in parentheses) is tentative and subject to small adjustments. See syllabus for details on missed or late work for assessment.

- Individual Assignments (5): 40%
- Mini-Project (1): 25%
- Test #1 (Midterm: in class/online) (1): 15%
- Test #2 (Final: in-person/online) (1): 20%

### Assignments

Assignments are larger and somewhat more challenging development tasks that aim to reinforce the theoretical topics in the course and give you hands on practical experience in developing graphical user interfaces. These are scheduled to be completed once every two weeks throughout the semester.

Assignments should be completed using the course software (Java 8, IntelliJ, Git) see [Working with Git for Assignment and Examples] for more details.

### Mini-Project

The mini-project will be announced at the end of October and is meant to be a somewhat self-directed project. Criteria for assessment and example project ideas will be given. Note that the grades associated with the mini-project, so students should keep their expectations in line with the provided criteria and example projects.

The mini-project may be completed individually or in groups of two or three. Additional criteria or requirements will be provided for groups. Students will be responsible for findings their own partners.

### Weekly Quizzes or Coding Challenges

Quizzes and coding challenges will be announced in class at least one class (i.e., at least 2 days) before it is to take place. They will be designed to require no more than 30 minutes and evaluate a concept that was presented in lectures or during time.

Coding challenges will be small exercises asking you to fix or practice some practical programming concept. Coding challenges will use Git, in the same way as assignments.

Quizzes will be composed of multiple choice-style questions.

In both cases, you will be asked to stay on the class call on Teams while completing the activity. This way I can answer questions and provide clarifications without any problem.

### Tests

Tests will be longer than quizzes and are designed to test your understanding of the course content to that period. They will be designed to fit within 60 minutes, but on the days of tests we will plan on starting at 8:30am to ensure everyone has enough time to finish comfortably.

## Dates for Deliverables

**NOTE: All dates are tentative and are used as general targets.** Adjustments to dates will be made as needed and will give you additional time and to avoid major conflicts. Adjustments to these dates will be announced in lectures.
